# Human Freedom Index 
The project uses the human freedom index(HFI) - the most comprehensive freedom index for globally meaningful set of countries to identify strong indicators of a nation's freedom score. The index ranks countries freedom score based on a broad measure that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom. This project assess the impact of social, political and economic factors on freedom and the level of their impact.

## Project Scenario
We are a non government organization that conduct research and generate action to prevent abuses of human rights and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated. We are approaching the United Nations Development Programme to help guide aide to where it is most needed using the recent human freedom index score.Over the past 5 years the Human Freedom Index score, for many countries has decreased. Our study aims to find significant contributors of freedom globally, as it is measured by the human freedom index score variables.
