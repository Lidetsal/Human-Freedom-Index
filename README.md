# Human Freedom Index 
Using the human freedom index, this project assessed the relationships between freedom and other social , political and economic factors that impact a countryâ€™s freedom index score. Using regression model, we are aiming to understand phenomenons that have a strong correlation with a higher freedom score.

## Project Scenario
We are representing the United Nations Development Programme to help guide aide to where it is most needed.
Over the past 5 years the Human Freedom Index scores, for many countries, have decreased.
We want to find the reason for this, if it is security, economical, or political reasons, and give aide to
those specific areas to help increase the Human Freedom Index.
